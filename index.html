<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Hello! My name is Michael Lewis,
 I am a a software and full-stack developer. 
 I bring experience and skills from multiple jobs I've had the pleasure of working.
  I have skills in Software development and web design, but also in data analysis and cleaning data for use in company charts for deci- sion making.
   I also have experience in managing a team to comply with company policies and safety proce- dures in the workplace, as well as motivate and encourage them on our accomplishments.
